/// Implementation details for packet structures

// This file contains the detailed implementation of packet structures
// For now, these are placeholder implementations that need to be
// filled in with actual packet parsing logic based on the game's
// network protocol.

// Placeholder implementations will be replaced with actual parsing
// logic once the protocol is fully analyzed.

use super::structures::*;

// Example implementation for a complex packet
// This would be filled in with actual parsing logic

/*
Example of what a real packet implementation might look like:

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PKTSkillDamageNotify {
    pub source_id: u32,
    pub skill_id: u32,
    pub skill_effect_id: Option<u32>,
    pub skill_damage_events: Vec<SkillDamageEvent>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct SkillDamageEvent {
    pub target_id: u32,
    pub damage: u64,
    pub modifier: i32,
    pub cur_hp: i64,
    pub max_hp: i64,
    pub damage_attr: u32,
    pub damage_type: u32,
}

impl PacketParse for PKTSkillDamageNotify {
    fn parse(data: &[u8]) -> crate::Result<Self> {
        // Actual parsing implementation would go here
        // This would involve reading from the byte buffer
        // and deserializing according to the game's protocol
        todo!("Implement actual parsing")
    }
}
*/

// For now, all packet implementations are handled by the macro in definitions.rs
// with placeholder logic. These need to be replaced with actual implementations.
